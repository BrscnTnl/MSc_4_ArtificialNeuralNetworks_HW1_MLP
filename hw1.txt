CMP5133-Artificial Neural Networks
Homework 1 - MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON IMPLEMENTATION

Attached are the dataset and its description in UCI learning repository. 
You are going to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 12 inputs, one output and H hidden units. 

For detailed information about the dataset, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires.

IMPORTANT

"forestfires_data.xlsx" contains the training and validation sets.

Tasks
Preprocess the features of the dataset. Standardize the numerical features and use 1-of-C coding to convert the categorical features to numerical values.

Train MLP on training set and test the obtained network on validation set for different values of H from 1 to 10.

Plot raining and validation errors as a function of H.

----------------------------------------------
Submit your code, results (plots) and a short report explaining what you did.

This homework is due March 22, Wednesday, 23:59 *sharp (late submissions will not be accepted)
